      While it is true that you can change elements of stories and still keep
      them faithful to the source material, there is a limit. Some movies skirt
      close to that line, some keep far away from it, and some long jump over
      the line, and become a different story. World War Z’s movie is one of the
      ones that flings itself across that boundary, where the original and movie
      adaptation are wildly different from one another.

        >World War Z novel</a
      >
      is a fictional story written by Max Brooks, about a reporter interviewing
      survivors of a post zombie outbreak world. These interviews cover the
      entire timeline, from the outbreak with patient zero, to the spread world
      wide, the turning of the tide against the zombies, and the final culling
      of the infestation. The reporter is taking these interviews ten years
      after VC day, or “Victory in China Day,” which most agree is the official
      end to the war. The reporter, Max Brooks (yes, the reporter and the author
      are the same name), travels from a doctor in China who had encountered
      Patient Zero, and was later imprisoned, to a smuggler in Tibet, and a
      Canadian veteran in Greece recounting a mission in kyrgyzstan. A
      transplant doctor who used imported organs from China, where the outbreak
      occurred, to Israel, where a spy who had co-created the first report that
      proved the zombie outbreak actually existed. There are so many stories of
      different people with different experiences on how they contributed to the
      fight against the zombies (commonly referred to as zack). Too many, in
      fact, to cover here. A couple highlights of the book would be Jurgen
      Warmbrunn’s interview on the creation of the “Warmbrunn-Knight” report,
      and Xolelwa Azania’s interview on the creation of the Redeker Plan.

      The
      <a href="https://zombie.fandom.com/wiki/Redeker_Plan" target="_blank"
        >Redeker Plan</a
      >
      is still widely remembered by fans of the book. It was an
      evacuation/defence plan which outlined what a country needed to do in
      order to survive. A few key points of the plan was to clear a safe zone to
      relocate survivors, a place that could aid the defence with natural
      boundaries. The second part of the plan was outlining the saving of
      civilians. Not every civilian could be saved, they didn’t have the
      resources to do so. They only evacuated a fraction of the population to
      serve as a workforce for the safe zone. The rest of the survivors were to
      be herded into areas where they were semi-protected and supplied, but far
      enough away from the safe zone that Zack would be too distracted with them
      to deal with the main area. As one can imagine, a lot of people resented
      Redeker for his callousness in the decisions he made, yet almost every
      country adopted a version of the Redeker Plan. After presenting his plan
      to the South African government, Redeker disappeared, and hadn’t been seen
      since, according to Azania, which was when he took over for Redeker. After
      finishing the interview, Brooks left the island that Azania’s facility
      resided upon, and signed out of Robben Island Psychiatric Institution. It
      is here revealed that Azania was Redeker, and had gone through such a
      dramatic mental change that he no longer recognized himself as who he was,
      and had a mental break.

      There are so many stories told throughout the novel, so many different
      perspectives, experiences, lives that lived through the most catastrophic
      event in human history. There was an actual, genuine war waged against the
      zombies, with front lines and back lines, and military philosophy had to
      change drastically to counter the new threat. Now, what does the movie do
      with all of these stories, which all have huge depth and explore wide
      berths of ideologies and perspectives? Absolutely nothing. World War Z the
      movie is a standard zombie movie, with standard zombie movie plot
      elements. There is a way better video on the topic that is highly
      recommended to watch, linked

        >here</a
      >, but the plot is extremely simple. The main character is stuck in
      traffic when zombies begin attacking. The main character, Gerry Lane, is a
      former UN investigator, and when the zombies attack, he and his family
      take refuge in an apartment building, before being airlifted out by a
      helicopter. They are taken to a US vessel in the Atlantic ocean, and Gerry
      is convinced to go with a UN doctor to Korea to find Patient Zero and
      study them for a vaccine. They arrive at night in the rain, and are
      ambushed by zombies. While trying to run back into the plane, the doctor
      slips on the ramp, falls, and the gun he was holding goes off directly in
      his head. The doctor trips, and dies to his own gun going off in front of
      his head. The rest of the movie doesn’t lack these poor writing choices,
      there are multiple other points in the movie which lack quality writing,
      the whole movie’s writing had gone pretty bad because of the script
      rewrites. Originally, the movie was going to be a lot like the book, with
      Gerry Lane traveling around interviewing people after the zombie war, just
      like the book, but the script was rewritten, and instead of a faithful
      recreation of the book, you get a standard zombie action movie.

      There is almost nothing present in the movie that can be found in the
      book, other than one character and one country’s actions, and even then,
      those actions are different in the book. In the movie, Jurgen Warmbrunn
      was a high ranking Mossad member who Gerry had to meet with. The other
      remnant in the movie of the book is Israel’s actions. In the novel,
      Warmbrunn is a spy for Israel, and together with a friend they created the
      Warmbrunn-Knight report, which was the first piece of data that showed the
      world that zombies existed. After presenting the report, Israel pulled
      back from its occupied territory, and created a safe zone, where anyone
      who lived or had lived in Israel was welcome to be protected. Israel also
      reveals to the UN the report, giving other countries a warning. In the
      movie, Israel does create a safe zone, and it does allow anyone in, but
      they don’t give the world any warning, nor was the Warmbrunn-Knight report
      mentioned.

      The World War Z movie is such a bad adaptation because it ignores all of
      the source material and themes that made the original story so intriguing.
      It drops every bit of the novel that made it unique and changes them for a
      mediocre zombie action movie.
